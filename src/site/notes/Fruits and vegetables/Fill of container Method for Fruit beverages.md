This method helps determine the percentage of a container's volume occupied by the food product. It's primarily designed for cans but can also be used for wide-mouth glass jars.

**Equipment:**

- Headspace Gauge (Ruler works)

**Procedure:**

1. Open the container (can opener for cans, remove lid for jars).
2. Measure the distance from the top of the container to the food level (headspace) at the center. If uneven, take multiple measurements and average them.
3. Empty the food onto a sieve to determine drained weight. Wash, dry, and weigh the empty container (T).
4. Fill the container with water to within 5mm of the top (use headspace gauge). Weigh the container with water (W1).
5. Remove water until the level matches the food level measured earlier. Weigh the container with remaining water (W2). (Water temperature should be consistent for both weighings.)

**Calculation:**

% Fill = (W2 - T) / (W1 - T) * 100

**Where:**

- T: Weight of empty container
- W1: Weight of container + water (first)
- W2: Weight of container + water (second)
