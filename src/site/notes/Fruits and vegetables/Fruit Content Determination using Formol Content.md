This method estimates fruit content by measuring the juice's reaction to formaldehyde. Formaldehyde releases one hydrogen ion per amino acid molecule, allowing titration with a base to determine amino acid content.

**Principle:**

1. **Formaldehyde Reaction:** Formaldehyde solution reacts with primary amino groups in the sample, releasing one hydrogen ion (H+) per reacting amino acid molecule. Secondary amino groups in histidine react minimally, while tertiary nitrogens and guanidine groups don't react at all.
2. **pH Titration:** The sample is neutralized to a specific pH using sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Formaldehyde solution is then added, causing the release of H+ ions and lowering the pH. The solution is then titrated back to the original neutral pH with NaOH.
3. **Formol Number:** The volume of NaOH used in the final titration is used to calculate the formol number. This number represents the relative amount of amino acids present in the sample, expressed as the volume of 0.1 N NaOH required to neutralize the released H+ ions per 100 mL of juice or 100 g of concentrate (rounded to whole numbers).

**Equipment:**

- pH meter

**Reagents:**

- 0.25 N Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
- Formaldehyde solution (pH adjusted to 8.1 with NaOH)
- 30% Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)

**Procedure:**

1. Neutralize 25mL fruit juice (or 10mL diluted lemon juice) with 0.25 N NaOH to pH 8.1 using a pH meter.
2. Add 10mL formaldehyde solution and wait 1 minute.
3. Titrate the solution back to pH 8.1 with 0.25 N NaOH using a pH meter.
    - If >20mL NaOH is needed, repeat using 15mL formaldehyde solution.
4. If sulfur dioxide is present, add a few drops of 30% hydrogen peroxide before neutralization.

**Calculation:**

Record the volume of 0.1 N NaOH used as the formol number (per 100mL juice/gm concentrate). Round to whole numbers.

**Interpretation:**

- Generally, a lower formol number indicates riper fruit as amino acid content decreases during ripening.
- Slight increases in formol number may occur during storage.
- Processing techniques like ion exchange or adding ascorbic acid can decrease the formol number.

**Note:**

- Literature may use a different formol number definition (mL N NaOH per 100mL sample), resulting in 10x smaller values.

**Fruit Content Calculation (for Orange Juice):**

- Fruit content (%) = 1.05 * Formol Number
