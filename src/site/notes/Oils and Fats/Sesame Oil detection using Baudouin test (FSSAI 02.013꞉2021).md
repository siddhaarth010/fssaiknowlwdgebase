**Scope:** This method identifies sesame oil based on the presence of sesamolin, a unique lignan compound.

**Safety Precaution:**

- **Hydrochloric acid:** Corrosive liquid. Handle with care to prevent contact with skin, eyes, or inhalation.

**Principle:** A pink or red color develops in the presence of hydrochloric acid and furfural solution, indicating sesame oil. This color formation is due to the reaction between furfural and sesamolin, present only in sesame oil.

**Equipment:**

- General [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- Glass stopper test tubes or measuring cylinders

**Materials:**

- Concentrated hydrochloric acid (Sp. Gr. 1.19)
- Furfural solution (2% in freshly distilled ethyl alcohol)

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]
**Method:**

2. In a 25 mL measuring cylinder (or test tube) with a glass stopper, combine 5 mL of the oil/fat sample (melted if solid), 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 0.4 mL of furfural solution. Stopper the container and shake vigorously for 2 minutes.
4. Allow the mixture to settle and separate into layers.
6. A pink or red color in the lower acid layer indicates the presence of sesame oil.
8. Confirmation test: Add 5 mL of water and shake again.
    
    - Persistent pink/red color in the acid layer confirms sesame oil.
    - Disappearance of color indicates sesame oil absence. (Note: dilute furfural solution is used to avoid a violet tint from furfural with hydrochloric acid).
    

**Important Note:**

- Test the sample for interfering chromogenic substances (substances that develop color with hydrochloric acid).
    
    - In a separate test tube, combine 5 mL of the sample with 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and shake.
    - If no pink or red color develops in the aqueous layer, proceed with the main test.
    - If a pink or red color appears, remove the colored acid layer and repeat the procedure until no further coloration occurs. Then, perform the sesame oil test as described above.
    

**Inference:**

A pink or red color in the lower acid layer indicates the presence of sesame oil, assuming no interfering substances are present.
