**Scope:** This method determines the cloud point of palmolein, which is the temperature at which crystals begin to form, making the oil cloudy.

**Principle:** The cloud point is the specific temperature where the sample exhibits cloudiness due to initial crystallization.

**Equipment:**

- General [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- Oil sample bottle (115 mL)
- Thermometer (2-68°C range)
- Water bath (with temperature control)

**Materials:**

- Palmolein oil sample

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Method:**

2. Ensure the sample is completely dry. Heat 60-75g of palmolein to 130°C just before testing.
4. Pour approximately 45 mL of the heated oil into the sample bottle and place it in the water bath.
6. Begin cooling the water bath while stirring the oil with the thermometer to maintain even temperature.
8. Once the sample reaches about 10°C above the expected cloud point, start stirring steadily and rapidly in a circular motion to prevent crystal formation on the sides or bottom of the bottle.
10. Do not remove the thermometer from this point onwards to avoid introducing air bubbles.
12. Maintain the bottle's position such that the oil and water bath surface levels are aligned.
14. Remove the bottle from the bath and record the temperature when the part of the thermometer submerged in the oil becomes invisible when viewed horizontally through the bottle.
16. This temperature is the cloud point.

**Inference:**

This test helps detect the presence of palmolein in other oils like groundnut oil. Higher palmolein content (over 10%) in groundnut oil will raise the cloud point due to the presence of more palmitic glycerides in palmolein/palm oil.
