**Scope:** This method determines the iodine value of an oil/fat sample. The iodine value reflects the degree of unsaturation (double bonds) in the fat.

**Caution:**

Handle acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, carbon tetrachloride, and potassium iodide with appropriate care due to their corrosive and hazardous nature.

**Principle:**

The oil/fat sample is dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and reacts with excess Wijs solution (iodine monochloride in acetic acid). Excess iodine is then titrated with sodium thiosulfate solution to determine the amount of iodine consumed by the fat.

**Importance:**

The iodine value indicates the level of unsaturation in the fat. Higher values indicate more double bonds and a higher degree of unsaturation.

**Apparatus:**

- Standard [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- Erlenmeyer flasks
- Brown glass bottles
- Beakers
- Burettes
- Pipettes
- Volumetric flasks

**Materials and Reagents:**

- Potassium dichromate
- Hydrochloric acid
- Glacial acetic acid
- Carbon tetrachloride
- Iodine monochloride (ICl)
- Potassium iodide
- Starch solution
- Mercuric iodide
- Sodium thiosulfate solution
- Resublimed iodine
- Dried chlorine
- Saturated Cl- water

**Preparation of Reagents:**

- **Potassium Iodide Solution (10%):**
    - Dissolve 100 g potassium iodide (free from potassium iodate) in enough distilled water to make 1 L. Prepare fresh solution.

- **Starch Indicator:**
    - Mix 5 g of starch and 0.01 g of mercuric iodide with 30 mL of cold water. Slowly pour this mixture with stirring into 1 L of boiling water. Boil for 3 minutes. Allow to cool and decant the clear supernatant.
- **Wijs Solution (Iodine Monochloride):**
    - **Method 1:**
        
        - Dissolve 10 mL of iodine monochloride in about 1800 mL of glacial acetic acid and shake vigorously.
        - Standardize with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution (see Sodium Thiosulfate prep below). Adjust volume to achieve an approximate 0.2 N concentration.
    - **Method 2:**
        
        - Dissolve 13 g of resublimed iodine in 1000 mL of acetic acid.
        - Pass dried chlorine gas (dried through H2SO4) until the original sodium thiosulfate titer value is nearly doubled.
        - Reserve some original iodine solution for adjustment if needed.
    - Store in an amber colored bottle sealed with paraffin until ready for use. Store in the dark below 30°C.
    - **I/Cl Ratio Determination:**
        
        - Pipette 5 mL Wijs solution into a flask containing 150 mL saturated NaCl solution and some glass beads.
        - Heat to boiling, boil for 10 minutes, cool, and add sulfuric acid (1:49 dilution) and potassium iodide solution (15%).
        - Titrate with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution.
        - Calculate I/Cl ratio using the formula provided in the original text. (I/Cl ratio should be 1.10 ± 0.1)
- **Standard Sodium Thiosulfate Solution (0.1 N):**
    
    - Dissolve approximately 24.8 g of sodium thiosulfate crystals (Na2S2O3.5H2O) in distilled water and make up to 1000 mL.
    - Standardize with potassium dichromate (see below).
    
- **Potassium Dichromate (K2Cr2O7):** Dry at 105°C for 1 hour before use.

**Method:**

**Preparation:**

1. Refer to the table to determine the appropriate weight of your dry oil/fat sample for analysis. This weight should ensure 50-60% excess Wijs solution compared to the amount needed for the reaction.
![Pasted image 20240510154924.png](/img/user/Pictures/Pasted%20image%2020240510154924.png)
1. Weigh the oil/fat sample accurately and transfer it to a 500 mL glass stoppered conical flask. Add 25 mL of carbon tetrachloride and mix well.

**Wijs Solution and Reaction:**

1. Pipette 25 mL of Wijs solution into the flask containing the oil/fat mixture.
2. Wet the glass stopper with potassium iodide solution and replace it on the flask.
3. Swirl the flask to ensure proper mixing.
4. Store the flask in the dark for a designated time:
    - 30 minutes for non-drying and semi-drying oils.
    - 1 hour for drying oils.

**Important Note:** Perform a blank determination simultaneously following steps 1-4, but without adding the oil/fat sample.

**Titration:**

1. After the designated reaction time, add 15 mL of potassium iodide solution to the flask.
2. Rinse the stopper with the solution and add 100 mL of recently boiled and cooled water.
3. Titrate the liberated iodine with standardized sodium thiosulfate solution using starch as an indicator.
4. The endpoint is reached when the blue color formed disappears entirely after thorough shaking with the stopper on.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Slight temperature variations can significantly affect the titer of the iodine solution.
- To minimize this effect, always perform the blank and sample determinations simultaneously.

**Calculation:**

Iodine value (g iodine/100 g oil) = (12.69 * (B - S) * N) / W

- B = volume (mL) of sodium thiosulfate for the blank
- S = volume (mL) of sodium thiosulfate for the sample
- N = normality of sodium thiosulfate solution
- W = weight (g) of the oil/fat sample
- Units = g of iodine per 100g
