**Scope:** This method determines the saponification value of an oil/fat sample. The saponification value is the amount of potassium hydroxide (KOH) required to saponify 1 gram of fat.

**Caution:**

Potassium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, and sodium carbonate are corrosive and can cause severe harm if mishandled. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.

**Principle:**

The oil sample is boiled with an excess KOH solution in alcohol (saponification). Excess KOH is then measured by titration with hydrochloric acid.

**Significance:**

The saponification value reflects the average molecular weight of fatty acids in the fat. Lower values indicate longer fatty acid chains and vice versa.

**Apparatus:**

- Standard [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- 250 mL conical flask with ground glass joints
- Air condenser or reflux condenser (at least 65 cm long)
- Hot water bath or thermostat-controlled electric hot plate
- 1000 mL volumetric flask/stoppered flask
- Weighing flask
- Balance

**Materials and Reagents:**

- Aldehyde-free alcohol
- Potassium hydroxide (KOH)
- Distilled water
- Phenolphthalein indicator solution (1.0% in alcohol)
- Hydrochloric acid (0.5 N, standardized)
- Anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Method:**

1. Melt and filter the sample (if necessary) to remove impurities and moisture. Ensure the sample is completely dry.
2. Weigh 1.5-2.0 g of the sample into a flask. Include a blank determination (without sample).
3. Add 25 mL of alcoholic KOH solution to each flask.
4. Reflux the samples with condensers on a hot water bath until saponification is complete (clear solution with no oil). This may take up to an hour.
5. After cooling, rinse the condenser with hot alcohol (neutral to phenolphthalein).
6. Titrate the excess KOH in each flask with 0.5 N hydrochloric acid using phenolphthalein indicator until the endpoint is reached (color change).

**Calculation:**

Saponification Value (mg KOH/g oil) = (B - S) * N / W

Where:

- B = Volume (mL) of HCl for the blank
- S = Volume (mL) of HCl for the sample
- N = Normality of the HCl solution
- W = Weight (g) of the oil/fat sample

**Note:** For dark-colored solutions, consider using thymolphthalein or alkali blue 6B indicator or adding methylene blue solution to the phenolphthalein indicator.
