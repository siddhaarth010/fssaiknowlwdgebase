**Scope:** This method determines the unsaponifiable matter content in an oil/fat sample. Unsaponifiable matter consists of substances soluble in the oil that remain insoluble in water after saponification. Examples include sterols, alcohols, pigments, and some hydrocarbons.

**Caution:**

Petroleum ether, diethyl ether, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide are corrosive and hazardous if mishandled. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.

**Principle:**

The oil sample is saponified with KOH in alcohol. The unsaponifiable matter is then extracted with petroleum ether and isolated by evaporation.

**Determination:**

- The weight of the residue after evaporation represents the unsaponifiable matter.
- A correction is made for any free fatty acids present in the extract.

**Apparatus:**

- Standard [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- 250 mL flask (flat-bottom or conical, with ground glass joint)
- 1 meter air condenser
- 500 mL separating funnel
- Weighing balance (accurate to 10 mg)

**Materials and Reagents:**

- KOH solution (alcoholic)
- Ethyl alcohol (aldehyde-free and 95%)
- Phenolphthalein indicator solution
- Petroleum ether (40-60°C)
- Sodium hydroxide solution (0.02 N)
- Acetone (analytical grade)
- Anhydrous sodium sulfate

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Method:**

1. Weigh 5 g of the sample into a flask and add 50 mL of alcoholic KOH solution.
2. Reflux the mixture for one hour (or until saponification is complete).
3. Wash the condenser with ethanol and transfer the saponified mixture to a separatory funnel. Rinse the flask with ethanol and water (50 mL total).
4. Cool the mixture, add 50 mL of petroleum ether, shake vigorously, and allow layers to separate.
5. Transfer the lower soap layer to another separatory funnel and repeat the ether extraction three times (50 mL each).
    - If an emulsion forms, add a small amount of ethanol or KOH solution.
    - Some high-matter oils may require additional extractions.
6. Combine all ether extracts in a separatory funnel and wash them with aqueous alcohol and water to remove alkali.
7. Transfer the washed ether extract to a pre-weighed flask and evaporate the solvent using a water bath.
8. Remove the last traces of solvent by drying at 100°C for 30 minutes. Record the weight of the residue (unsaponifiable matter).
9. Dissolve the residue in neutralized ethanol and titrate with sodium hydroxide solution to determine free fatty acids.

**Calculation:**

- Unsaponifiable matter (%) = ((A - B) / W) x 100
    - A = weight of residue (g)
    - B = weight of free fatty acids (g)
    - W = weight of sample (g)
