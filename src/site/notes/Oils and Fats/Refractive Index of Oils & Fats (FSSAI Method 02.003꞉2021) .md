**Scope:** This method determines the refractive index of oil/fat samples. Refractive index is a property that varies with temperature and light wavelength.

**Significance:** The refractive index of an oil/fat increases with:

- Higher degree of unsaturation in fatty acids
- Longer chain length of fatty acids

**Principle:** The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the oil/fat sample. It's also expressed as the ratio of the sine of the incidence angle to the sine of the refraction angle when a specific light wave (usually sodium light at 589.3 nm) enters the oil/fat from air.

**Measurement:** A refractometer is used to measure the refractive index of the sample.

**Apparatus:**

- Standard [[Glassware\|glassware]] 
- Refractometer (one of the following):
    - Abbe Refractometer
    - Butyro Refractometer

**Abbe Refractometer Procedure:**

2. Open the double prism using the screw head and place a drop of oil on the prism surface.
4. Close the prisms firmly by tightening the screw heads.
6. **Temperature Control is Crucial:** Refractive index is significantly affected by temperature. The refractometer should be equipped with a thermostatically controlled water bath and a pump to circulate water at a constant temperature (± 0.1°C).

**Butyro Refractometer Procedure:**

2. Readings from a Butyro Refractometer can be converted to refractive index using a table provided with the instrument or if the machine is advanced enough it can convert it automatically.
4. **Light Source:**
    - If the refractometer has a compensator, a tungsten lamp or daylight can be used.
    - Otherwise, a monochromatic light source like a sodium vapor lamp (589.3 nm) is required.

**Materials and Reagents:**

- Oil/Fat Sample

**Calibration:**

- The refractometer is calibrated using a glass prism with a known refractive index or with distilled water (whose refractive index is 1.3330 at 20.0°C and 1.3306 at 40.0°C, the usual measurement temperature).

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Method of Analysis:**

1. **Melt and Filter (if necessary):** If the sample is solid, melt it and then filter it through filter paper containing anhydrous sodium sulfate (1-2 g per 10 g sample, preheated at 50°C) to remove impurities and moisture.
2. Ensure the sample is completely dry.
3. Turn on the refractometer and circulate water through the instrument.
4. Set the desired temperature on the refractometer.
5. Clean and dry the prisms.
6. Place a few drops of the sample on the prism surface.
7. Close the prisms and wait for 1-2 minutes.
8. Adjust the instrument and lighting to get a clear reading. Record the refractive index or butyrorefractometer number depending on the instrument used.
9. **Cleaning after Measurement:**
    - Wipe the prism with tissue to remove the oil.
    - Clean the prism with isopropanol and petroleum ether to prepare it for the next sample analysis.

**Calculation (Temperature Correction):**

The refractive index is reported at a specific temperature (usually 40°C). If the measurement temperature differs, a correction factor is applied using the following formula:

$$R = R₁ + K (T₁ - T)$$

Where:

- R = Refractive index at the specified temperature (T°C)
- R₁ = Reading at the measured temperature (T₁°C)
- K = Constant (0.000365 for fats and 0.000385 for oils if using Abbe Refractometer; 0.55 for fats and 0.58 for oils if using Butyro Refractometer)
- T₁ = Measured temperature (°C)
- T = Specified temperature (usually 40°C)
