**Scope:** This method outlines the detection of rancidity (unpleasant odor/flavor) in edible fats/oils caused by degradation.

**Safety Precautions:**

- **Diethyl ether:** Highly flammable, inhalation hazard, skin/eye irritant. Use with caution in a well-ventilated area.
- **Hydrochloric acid:** Corrosive liquid. Wear proper PPE (gloves, eye protection) to avoid contact.
- **Acetic acid:** Corrosive liquid. Handle with care to prevent skin/eye contact or inhalation.
- **Trichloroacetic acid:** Corrosive, can cause severe burns and irritation. Avoid inhalation and contact.

**Principle:** The Kreis test qualitatively and quantitatively detects rancidity, particularly aldehydes with characteristic odors. Color development is critical and requires optimization.

**Materials:**
- Phloroglucinol
- Diethyl ether
- Concentrated hydrochloric acid
- Trichloroacetic acid
- Glacial acetic acid

**Reagent Preparation:**
1. 0.1% Phloroglucinol in diethyl ether
2. 1% Phloroglucinol in glacial acetic acid
3. 30% Trichloroacetic acid in glacial acetic acid

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Analysis Methods:**

**Qualitative:**
1. Shake 5 mL oil with 5 mL of 0.1% phloroglucinol in diethyl ether.
2. Add 5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. A pink color indicates incipient rancidity.

**Quantitative - Method 1:**
1. Weigh 0.8-1.02 g of oil/fat into a 100 mL beaker.
2. Melt the fat sample (if solid).
3. Slowly add 20 mL of 0.1% phloroglucinol in diethyl ether (freshly prepared) while stirring until dissolved.
4. Transfer to a separating funnel, add 10 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid, shake, and allow separation.
5. Measure the acid layer color in a 1-inch Lovibond cell using red, yellow, and blue glasses.
6. Express results in red Lovibond units
    - Up to 3: Incipient rancidity
    - 3-8: End of induction period
    - Over 8: Definite rancidity

**Quantitative - Method 2:**
1. Shake 5 mL oil with 5 mL chloroform in a stoppered test tube.
2. Add 10 mL of 30% trichloroacetic acid in glacial acetic acid and 1 mL of 1% phloroglucinol in glacial acetic acid.
3. Incubate at 45Â°C for 15 minutes.
4. Add 4 mL of ethanol and measure absorbance at 545 nm.

**Interpretation:**
- **Qualitative:**
    - Absorbance < 0.15: No rancidity
    - Absorbance > 0.2: Incipient rancidity
    - Absorbance ~ 1.0: Highly rancid
- **Quantitative:** Refer to method-specific interpretations.
