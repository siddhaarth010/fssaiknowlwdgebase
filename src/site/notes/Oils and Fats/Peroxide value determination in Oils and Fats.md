**Summary**

This method outlines the determination of peroxide value in animal/vegetable fats & oils, flavors, and fragrances. Peroxide value indicates the extent of oxidation (presence of peroxides) in a sample.

**Application**

- Most fats/oils (animal & vegetable)
- Flavors & Fragrances

**Principle**

1. Sample is dissolved in an acetic acid-organic solvent mixture.
2. Potassium iodide (KI) solution is added, liberating iodine (I₂) from peroxides.
3. Liberated I₂ is titrated with sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) solution.
4. Peroxide value is calculated based on Na₂S₂O₃ consumption.

**Equipment**

- Balance ( ± 1 mg)
- Burette
- Erlenmeyer flask (250 mL) with stopper
- Stopwatch

**Reagents**

- Chloroform (analytical grade)
- Cyclohexane (analytical grade)
- Formic acid
- Glacial acetic acid (analytical grade)
- Isooctane (analytical grade)
- Methanol (reagent grade)
- Starch (analytical grade)
- Sodium thiosulfate solution (0.01 or 0.1 mol/L)
- Thyodene indicator
- Potassium iodide (analytical grade)
- Distilled water

**Procedure**

1. **Sample Prep:**
    
    - Protect sample from air, store cool, and avoid opening before testing.
    - Solid fats shouldn't be melted beforehand.
    - Weigh ~3g of sample (center portion) into the flask.
2. **Reaction & Titration:**
    
    - Add 50 mL of chosen solvent mixture (I, II, or III).
    - Add 1 mL of fresh KI solution, swirl for 60 seconds.
    - Add 100 mL water and shake.
    - Titrate with Na₂S₂O₃ solution (appropriate concentration) using starch or Thyodene indicator until endpoint (colorless).
    - Perform a blank titration.
3. **Calculation**
    
    - Peroxide Value (meq/kg) = (V₁ - V₀) * c * T / m
        - V₁ = Na₂S₂O₃ consumption (sample)
        - V₀ = Na₂S₂O₃ consumption (blank)
        - c = Na₂S₂O₃ solution concentration (mol/L)
        - T = Na₂S₂O₃ solution titer
        - m = Sample weight (g)
4. **Unit Conversion**
    
    - Peroxide value (mmol/L) = Peroxide value (meq/kg) / 2 (conversion factor)

**Considerations**

- Accuracy can be challenging due to:
    - Difficulty obtaining standard peroxides
    - Peroxide instability
- Results may vary due to procedural differences.
- Perform replicate analyses for better accuracy.
- Consider potentiometric titration for dark-colored samples.
