**Scope:** This method determines the flash point of a liquid, the lowest temperature at which it ignites when exposed to a flame.

**Principle:** The sample is heated in a closed cup with continuous stirring. A small test flame is applied periodically while stirring is paused. The flash point is the minimum temperature at which the vapor ignites momentarily upon test flame application.

**Equipment:**

- General [[Glassware\|glassware]]
- Pensky-Martens closed cup apparatus with thermometer

**Materials:**

- Oil/fat sample

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click Here]]
1. Remove any water from the sample using calcium chloride, filter paper, or absorbent cotton.
2. Warm the sample if necessary, but not exceeding 16°C below the expected flash point and not for extended periods.

**Method:**

1. Clean and dry all cup parts and accessories thoroughly, removing any cleaning solvents.
2. Place the tester on a level and stable surface.
3. Fill the cup with the oil sample to the designated mark.
4. Attach the lid, activate heating elements, insert the thermometer, and adjust the test flame to 4.0 mm diameter.
5. Heat the sample at a rate of 5-6°C per minute.
6. Continuously stir the sample at 1-2 revolutions per second during heating.
7. Begin applying the test flame at a whole number temperature no higher than 17°C below the expected flash point.
8. Every 5°C temperature increase, stop stirring and apply the test flame by opening the shutter and lowering it for 0.5 seconds.
9. Quickly return the test flame to its raised position. Do not stir while applying the flame.
10. Resume stirring after raising the test flame.
11. The flash point is the temperature reading when a distinct vapor flash occurs inside the cup upon test flame application.

**Units:**

- Flash point: °C (degrees Celsius)
