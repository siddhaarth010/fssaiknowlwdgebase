**Scope:** This method determines the water/moisture content in oil/fat samples.

**Caution:** Phosphorus pentoxide (drying agent) is harmful if swallowed, inhaled, or comes in contact with eyes/skin.

**Principle:** Moisture content is estimated by the weight loss of the sample after heating at 105°C.

**Apparatus:**

- Standard [[Glassware\|glassware]] 
- Metal dishes (7-8 cm diameter, 2-3 cm deep) with tight-fitting lids
- Weighing balance

**Materials:**

- Oil/fat samples
- Phosphorus pentoxide (desiccant)

**Sample Preparation:** [[Oils and Fats/Sample Preparation for Oil & Fat Analysis (AOAC 981.11)\|Click here]]

**Method:**

1. Weigh a pre-dried and tared dish containing 5-10g of well-mixed oil/fat sample. 
2. Loosen the dish lid and heat in a 105±1°C oven for 1 hour.
3. Remove the dish, close the lid, and cool in a desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide.
4. Weigh the cooled dish.
5. Repeat steps 2-4, heating for an additional hour each time, until the weight difference between two consecutive weighings is less than 1mg.
6. Perform the analysis in duplicate (run the test twice with separate samples).

**Calculation:**

Moisture & Volatile Matter (%) = (W₁ x 100) / W

Where:

- W₁ = Loss in weight (grams) after drying
- W = Weight (grams) of the initial sample
