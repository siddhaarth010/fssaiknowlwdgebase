Oils and fats are important parts of human diet and more than 90 percent of the world
production from vegetable, animal and marine sources is used as food or as an ingredient in food
products. Oils and fats are a rich source of dietary energy and contain more than twice the caloric
value of equivalent amount of sugar. Their functional and textural characteristics contribute to the
flavour and palatability of natural and prepared foods. They contain certain fatty acids which play an
important role in nutrition and are also carriers of fat soluble vitamins.
The methods described in this manual are applicable for evaluating quality parameters such as
