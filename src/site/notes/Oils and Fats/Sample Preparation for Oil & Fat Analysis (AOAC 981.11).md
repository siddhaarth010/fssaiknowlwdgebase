## **Liquid Oils:**

1. **Clear, Sediment-Free:** Invert the container several times and use directly
2. **Sediment Present:** Ensure all sediment is released from the container walls. Distribute it uniformly throughout the oil before moisture determination.
3. **Moisture-Sensitive Analysis (e.g., Iodine Value):**
    
    - Dry the sample with anhydrous sodium sulfate (1-2 g per 10 g sample).
    - Hold the mixture in an oven at 50°C.
    - Stir vigorously and filter to obtain a clear filtrate.

## **Solid & Semisolid Samples:**

1. **Moisture & Volatile Matter:** Gently heat the sample to soften it (without melting). Mix thoroughly before analysis.
2. **Other Determinations:** Melt the sample in a drying oven at least 10°C above its melting point.
    - If clear, proceed directly.
    - If turbid or contains sediment, filter the sample inside the oven.
3. **Moisture-Sensitive Analysis (e.g., Iodine Value):** Same drying procedure as liquid oils with sodium sulfate.
4. **Storage:** Keep oils and fats cool, protected from light and air, to prevent rancidity.
