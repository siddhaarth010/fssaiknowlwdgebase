**Scope**

This method applies to most spices and condiments. However, for some cases with unique properties (hardness, high water/oil content), modifications or alternative methods might be necessary.

**Caution**

No specific caution mentioned.

**Principle**

Spices are ground to pass through a 1mm sieve.

**Equipment**

- Grinding mill: Made of non-absorbent material, easy to clean, minimal dead space. Enables quick, uniform grinding without excessive heat and minimal air contact. Adjustable to achieve 1mm particle size.
- Sieves: 1mm IS sieve or equivalent
- Sample container: Clean, dry, airtight glass container or suitable material that won't react with the sample. Large enough to hold the ground sample nearly but not completely full.

**Procedure**

1. Thoroughly mix the sample for analysis.
2. Grind a small portion of the sample with the grinding mill and discard.
3. Grind a slightly larger amount than needed for testing, avoiding excessive heating during grinding.
4. Carefully mix the ground material to prevent separation.
5. Transfer the ground material to the pre-dried sample container and immediately seal it.
