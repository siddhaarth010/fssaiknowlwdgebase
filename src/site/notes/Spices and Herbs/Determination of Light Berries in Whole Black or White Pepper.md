**Method No.**: FSSAI 10.019:2021  
### Scope

This method is applicable for determining the presence of light berries in whole black and white pepper (Piper nigrum L.)/ (Kalimirch) samples.

### Definition

**Light Berry**: A berry that has reached an apparently normal stage of development but floats in alcohol with a specific gravity of 0.80 to 0.82 at 25 ºC.

### Caution

Follow all safety precautions for handling organic solvents and special chemical hazards such as ethanol. Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for each reagent. Note that ethanol is a flammable liquid and can be hazardous in case of skin or eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation.

### Apparatus/Instruments

1. Electronic balance
2. 600 mL beaker
3. Blotting paper or other absorbent material

### Reagents

- Alcohol – water solution (specific gravity of 0.80 – 0.82). The alcohol may be ethyl alcohol, denatured spirit, or isopropanol.

### Sample Preparation

Remove extraneous matter and pinheads from a suitable mass of black or white whole pepper for the test.

### Method of Analysis

1. **Weigh 50 g of prepared sample** and transfer to a 600 mL beaker.
2. **Add 300 mL of alcohol – water solution** and stir with a spoon stirrer.
3. **Allow to settle for 2 minutes**, then spoon off the berries that float on the surface.
4. **Repeat stirring, settling, and removal** of floating berries until no more berries float on the surface in two successive stirrings.
    - Note: Only remove berries floating on the surface, not those suspended below the surface.
5. **Blot the removed berries** to remove excess liquid and spread them to air dry on absorbent material. Air dry for one hour and then weigh accurately.
6. **Replicate the process**: If the range of two replications is not over 0.8%, average these values to report as light berries. If the difference is more than 0.8%, perform a third replication and average all three values.

### Calculation

\text{Light berries (% by mass)} = \left( \frac{W1}{W2} \right) \times 100

Where:

- W1W1W1 = Mass of the light berries removed (Step 5)
- W2W2W2 = Mass of the sample taken for the test
