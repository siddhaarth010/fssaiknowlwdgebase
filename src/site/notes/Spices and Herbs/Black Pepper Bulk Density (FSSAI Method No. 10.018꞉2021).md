This obsidian note outlines the method for determining the bulk density of black pepper according to FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) Method No. 10.018:2021.

**Scope:**

- This method is applicable for measuring the bulk density of black pepper.

**Equipment:**

- 1-liter cylindrical measure with lid (aluminum alloy, brass, or stainless steel) - Internal diameter: 95 mm, Internal height: 142 mm
- Thin straight metal strip (approx. 10 mm width, 150 mm length)

**Procedure:**

1. Fill the 1-liter measure with the black pepper sample.
2. Gently shake the measure horizontally three times. Refill the measure to the brim as much as possible.
3. Tap the measure on a flat, hard surface three times, changing positions each time. Refill again, slightly over the brim.
4. Use the metal strip to level the top of the measure, removing excess material.
5. Weigh the contents of the measure to the nearest gram and record the mass.
6. The mass of the sample represents the bulk density in grams per liter (g/L).

**Calculation:**

Bulk density (g/L) = Mass of sample (g)

- I.S. Specification No. IS 1797 â€“ 1985 (Reaffirmed in 2009): Methods of Test for Spices and Condiments

**Additional Notes:**

- This method assumes the black pepper sample is dry. Moisture content can affect bulk density.
- Consider including safety precautions when handling spices, such as wearing gloves and avoiding dust inhalation.
