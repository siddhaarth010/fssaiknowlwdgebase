# Determination of Piperine Content of Black Pepper by UV-VIS Spectrophotometry

## Method No. FSSAI 10.020:2021

### Scope
This method determines the piperine content in black and white pepper.

### Caution
Follow all safety precautions for handling organic solvents and special chemical hazards for ethylene dichloride. See Material Safety Data Sheets for each reagent.

### Principle
Piperine is extracted into denatured alcohol, and absorbance is measured at the maximum absorbance between 342 nm and 345 nm. Other isomers of piperine and related compounds such as piperidine and piperyline, which also absorb at 340-345 nm, will also be included.

### Apparatus/Instruments
1. UV spectrophotometer – any suitable model
2. Analytical balance
3. 1 cm path length silica cuvettes
4. 125 mL amber Erlenmeyer flask/round bottom flask
5. Reflux condenser
6. Volumetric flasks – 100 mL, glass stoppered, amber colored
7. Anti-bumping granules
8. Funnel
9. Filter paper – Whatman No.2 or equivalent
10. Pipettes

### Reagents
1. Standard denatured alcohol (SDA) – mix 1000 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol and 50 mL of methyl alcohol.
2. Piperine – pure

### Preparation of Standard Solution
1. Weigh 100 mg of pure piperine into a 100 mL volumetric flask, add about 70 mL SDA, shake to dissolve, and make up to volume.
2. Pipette 10 mL into a 100 mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume.
3. Pipette 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mL aliquots into six 100 mL volumetric flasks and dilute to volume with SDA.
4. These solutions represent concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 μg/mL.
5. Set the spectrophotometer wavelength between 342-345 nm.
6. Adjust to zero absorbance with SDA in both reference and sample cell.
7. Determine the absorbance readings (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6) at the absorbance maxima between 342-345 nm with SDA in the reference cell.
8. Plot a graph of concentration against observed absorbance.
9. Determine the average absorbance obtained from the readings and express as μg/mL.

### Method of Analysis
#### For Black and White Pepper
1. Grind sample to pass a 60-mesh sieve and blend uniformly. Weigh 0.5 g of the test sample and transfer to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Protect from light.
2. Add about 70 mL SDA. Reflux and stir for 1 hour, cool to 25±2 °C, and filter quantitatively through paper into a 100 mL volumetric flask.
3. Transfer the rest of the extracted residue to the filter, wash thoroughly, and dilute to volume.
4. Pipette 2 mL of this solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask and dilute to mark with SDA.
5. Shake well and measure the absorbance reading of the solution at 342-345 nm within 15 min, using SDA as the reference solution.
6. [[Spices and Herbs/Sample Preparation for Spices and Herbs (FSSAI 10.001꞉2021)\|Refer to this]]

#### For Oleoresins
1. Weigh 1.000 g of well-mixed sample and transfer into a 100 mL volumetric flask.
2. Make up to volume with SDA and shake well until dissolved.
3. Pipette 10 mL of this solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask and fill to mark with SDA. Shake well.
4. Pipette 1 mL of this solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask and fill to mark with SDA. Shake well.
5. Using SDA as the reference solution, record absorbance of the solution at maxima 342-345 nm within 15 min.

### Calculation
Piperine (%) is calculated using the following formula:
$\text{Piperine (\%)} = \left( \frac{A_s}{A_{\text{avg}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{V}{W_s} \right) \times 100$
Where:
- $A_s$ = Absorbance of sample
- $A_{avg}$ = Average of standard absorbances, each normalized to 1μg/mL
- V = Dilution volume, milliliters
-  $W_s$  = Sample weight, grams
