This method determines the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) present in food additives, fruits, and vegetables. SO2 is a common preservative but needs to be regulated.

**Scope:**

This method is designed to determine the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) present in various food products, including:

- Food additives
- Fruits
- Vegetables

SO2 is a preservative commonly used in these products, but its levels are regulated due to potential health concerns. This method helps ensure food safety by measuring SO2 content.

**Principle:**

The Modified Monier-Williams Method utilizes a distillation process to separate and quantify SO2 from the sample. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Sample Acidification:** The sample is mixed with water and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a flask. The acidic environment converts sulfite (SO3²⁻), the form SO2 usually exists in food, back to free SO2 gas.
2. **Distillation:** The flask is heated, causing the SO2 gas to vaporize and rise. Nitrogen gas is continuously bubbled through the solution, carrying the SO2 vapor upwards.
3. **SO2 Trapping:** The SO2 gas travels through a condenser, where it cools and condenses back into a liquid. This liquid is collected in a trap containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
4. **SO2 Oxidation:** SO2 reacts with H2O2, converting it to sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This reaction consumes H2O2.
5. **Quantification:** After distillation, an indicator is added to the H2O2 solution in the trap. This solution is then titrated with a standardized sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The volume of NaOH used is proportional to the amount of H2O2 consumed by SO2 in the trap.

**Apparatus:**

- Conical flasks
- Beakers & pipettes
- Distillation apparatus (see image for specific setup):
    
    - Inlet adapter
    - Separatory funnel
    - Round-bottom flask
    - Gas inlet tube
    - Allihn condenser
    - Bubbler
    - Receiving vessel
    

**Reagents:**

- 3% Hydrogen peroxide solution (standardized)
- 0.1% Bromophenol blue solution
- 0.1% Phenolphthalein indicator solution
- Saturated sodium carbonate solution

**Procedure:**

2. Set up the distillation apparatus with cold circulating water in the condenser.
4. Add 20 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide to a conical flask and 5 mL to the trap.
6. Weigh 50 gm of well-mixed sample and transfer it to a 500 mL flask with 300 mL water through the gas inlet tube. Secure all connections.
8. Slowly add 20 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid through the inlet tube. Check for leaks by observing nitrogen flow (15-20 bubbles/minute).
10. Heat the solution to boiling (1 hour for dried fruits/vegetables, 30 minutes otherwise).
12. After boiling, wash the hydrogen peroxide solution from the trap into the conical flask. Rinse the trap with water.
14. Add 3 drops of bromophenol blue indicator and titrate with 0.05 N sodium hydroxide solution to a pale blue endpoint.
16. Perform a blank titration with 20 mL hydrogen peroxide and subtract the volume used from the sample titration.

**Calculation:**

```
μg SO2/gm (ppm) = (Titer x Normality of NaOH x 32.03 x 1000) / Sample Weight
```

- Titer = Volume of NaOH used in sample titration (mL)
- Normality of NaOH = 0.05 N
- 32.03 = Conversion factor (mg SO2 per mL 0.01 N NaOH)
