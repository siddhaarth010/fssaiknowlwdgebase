### Method No.
**FSSAI 03.025:2023 Revision No. & Date 0.0**

### Scope
The method is applicable to all varieties of biscuits (sweet, semisweet, crackers, cookies, and rusk), cream/filled biscuits, and all types of bread.

### Caution
- **Hot air oven**: Always wear insulated gloves when removing or placing samples in the heated oven. Open hot ovens with care. Stand to one side when opening the door to avoid high temperature.
- Exercise extreme caution when opening and closing desiccators.

### Principle
The sample is ground. A test portion is dried at 130 ± 3 °C to a constant mass. The loss in mass is expressed as a percentage.

### Apparatus/Instruments
- **Analytical balance**: Capable of weighing to an accuracy of 0.001 g.
- **Grinding mill/Waring blender**
- **Moisture dishes**: Made of porcelain, silica, glass, or aluminum, approximately 7.5 cm wide and 2.5 cm deep with tight-fitting lids.
- **Force air convection oven**: Thermostatically controlled to maintain a temperature between 105 ± 1 °C.
- **Desiccators**: Containing desiccant (Silica gel/P2O5, CaCl2).

### Sample Preparation
- **Powdered or granular substances**: Mix the contents of a whole pack and, if necessary, further grind in a clean and dry mortar to convert it into a homogeneous powder. Store the ground sample in a clean and dry airtight glass container.
- **Low moisture crisp products**: For biscuits, cookies, and rusks, break the contents of the whole pack into small pieces and subsequently grind the pieces either in an electrically driven, clean, dry blender or in a clean and dry mortar to a near-homogeneous powder. Store the powdered material in a dry airtight glass container. 
  - **Note**: Remove the coating/filling (cream, caramel, chocolate, marshmallow, jam, jelly, or any other filling) by gentle scraping before powdering the sample.
- **Semi-moist products**: For cakes, bread, buns, etc., cut the contents of the pack into small pieces with clean dry scissors or a sharp-edged knife and further grind in an electrically driven dry blender, ensuring the sample temperature does not rise above 45 °C during the operation.
  - For packs above 400 g, such as bread loaves, slice uniformly into thin slices with a sharp-edged knife. Take two slices from the center and two from each end, leaving the outermost end slices, and proceed as described above.

### Method of Analysis
1. Weigh accurately about 5 g of the powdered sample in the moisture dish previously dried in an oven and weighed.
2. Place the dish in the oven maintained at 105 ± 1 °C for four hours.
3. Cool in the desiccator and weigh.
4. Repeat the process of drying, cooling, and weighing at 30-minute intervals until the difference in two consecutive weights is less than 1 mg.
5. Record the lowest weight.

### Calculation
The moisture content, expressed as a percentage by mass of the product, is given by the following equation:

\[ \text{Moisture} (\%) = \frac{W1 - W2}{W1 - W} \times 100 \]

Where:
- \( W \) = Mass in g of the empty dish.
- \( W1 \) = Mass in g of the dish with the test portion before drying.
- \( W2 \) = Mass in g of the dish with the material after drying.
