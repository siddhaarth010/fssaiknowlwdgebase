### Method No.
**FSSAI 03.018:2023 Revision No. & Date 0.0**

### Scope
This method is for the determination of crude fiber in all food grain cereals and cereal products. It is applicable to materials from which the fat can be and is extracted to obtain workable residue, including grains, meals, flours, feeds, and fibrous materials.

### Caution
1. Use fume-hoods.
2. Handle ethyl alcohol with care as it is flammable.
3. Neutralize acid/base before disposal.
4. Avoid over-heating and rapid boiling during digestion.
5. Do not allow foam in the vessel to exceed 10 mm in height.
6. Handle sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with care as it is corrosive.
7. Wear gloves and eye protection when handling sodium hydroxide.

### Principle
Crude fiber is determined by the loss on ignition of the dried residue remaining after digestion of the sample with 1.25% (w/v) H2SO4 and 1.25% (w/v) NaOH solutions under specific conditions. The residue is separated by filtration, dried, and ashed. The weight loss from ashing corresponds to the crude fiber content.

### Apparatus/Instrument
- Soxhlet apparatus (optional)
- Digestion apparatus with condenser
- Digestion flask (1-liter Erlenmeyer flask with 45/50 ground joint recommended)
- Ashing dishes (silica, vitreosil, or porcelain)
- Filtering device (Buchner Funnel or equivalent)
- Desiccator with fresh desiccant (orange silica gel beads preferred)
- Analytical balance (accurate to 0.0001 g)
- Drying oven (capable of 105 ± 1 °C)
- Muffle furnace (capable of 500 ± 25 °C)

### Materials/Reagents
- Sulfuric acid, specific gravity 1.84 at 60 °F
- Sodium hydroxide pellets
- Ethyl alcohol, 95%, ACS grade
- Methylene chloride, anhydrous (dichloromethane), ACS grade
- Demineralized water
- Petroleum ether (boiling range 35 °–38 °C, dry-flask end point 52 °–60 °C)
- Antifoam (Antifoam A or B)
- Blue litmus paper
- Bumping chips or granules (Alundum crucibles or equivalent)

### Preparation of Reagents
- **Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) solution, 0.255 N**: Add 12.5 g conc. sulfuric acid to 200 mL demineralized water and make up to 1000 mL. Check concentration by titration.
- **Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, 0.312 N**: Dissolve 12.5 g sodium hydroxide pellets in 1000 mL demineralized water. Check concentration by titration.
- **Prepared ceramic fiber**: Blend 60 g ceramic fiber with 800 mL H2O. Treat 2 g of prepared ceramic fiber with acid and alkali as in determination. Correct crude fiber results for any blank.

### Method of Analysis
1. Weigh 2.5-3 g sample, transfer to Soxhlet extractor, and extract with petroleum ether. Air dry and transfer to a dry 1 L conical flask.
2. Add 200 mL H2SO4 solution, connect to condenser, and boil for 30 ± 1 min.
3. Filter through Buchner funnel or filter cloth, wash with boiling water until washings are no longer acid.
4. Transfer sample and ceramic fiber to digestion flask, add 200 mL NaOH solution, and boil for 28 min.
5. Filter through fine linen, wash with boiling water until no longer alkaline.
6. Wash residue with 200 mL boiling NaOH solution, boil for 30 min.
7. Filter through filter cloth, wash residue with boiling water and ethyl alcohol.
8. Dry in oven at 105 ± 2 °C, cool, and weigh.
9. Incinerate in muffle furnace, cool in desiccator, and weigh.

### Calculation and Expression of Units
Crude Fiber (% by mass) = \(\frac{W1 - W2}{W} \times 100\)

- W = Mass of moisture-free test material
- W1 = Mass of Gooch crucible and contents before ashing
- W2 = Mass of Gooch crucible containing asbestos and ash
