### Scope

This method determines the quantity of water, expressed as a percentage by mass, distilled and collected from spices containing volatile compounds.

### Caution

1. Toluene and hexane are highly flammable and hazardous upon skin contact, eye contact, ingestion, or inhalation.
2. Wear the required personal protective equipment.
3. Avoid sources of ignition.
4. Dispose of solvent waste following good laboratory practices and environmental health and safety protocols in your institution.

### Principle

The water content is determined by distilling the material with an organic liquid not miscible with water and collecting the distillate in a graduated tube.

### Apparatus/Instrument

1. **Analytical balance:** Accurate to 0.1 mg.
2. **Moisture distillation apparatus:** Includes a glass flask, reflux condenser, and a trap for collecting and measuring condensed water and returning condensed solvent to the flask.
    - **Flask:** 500 mL capacity, heat-resistant glass.
    - **Reflux condenser:** Water-cooled, glass, with a jacket approximately 400 mm long and an inner tube diameter of 9.5 to 12.5 mm.
    - **Receiver:** 5 mL capacity, heat-resistant glass, graduated at intervals of 0.1 mL.
    - **Heat source:** Oil bath or electric heater with heat control.
    - **Copper wire:** Long enough to extend through the condenser, with one end twisted into a spiral.

### Materials and Reagents

1. **Toluene:** For most spices.
2. **Hexane:** For capsicum, onion, garlic, and other spices containing large amounts of sugar.

**Note:** Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets and apply safety guidelines before using solvents.

### Preparation of Reagents

1. **Toluene:** Saturate with water by shaking and distill. Use the distillate for moisture determination.

### Sample Preparation

Prepare the test sample as described in the manual

### Method of Analysis

1. Clean the apparatus with chromic acid solution, rinse with distilled water, and dry completely.
2. Weigh 20 - 40 g of the prepared sample to the nearest 0.01 g. Transfer to the distilling flask with toluene.
3. Add enough toluene to cover the sample (about 75 mL).
4. Fill the receiving tube with toluene until it overflows into the distillation flask.
5. Insert a loose cotton plug in the top of the condenser.
6. Add pumice stones to prevent bumping. Distill slowly at about 2 drops per second until most water distills over, then increase to 4 drops per second.
7. Continue distilling until two consecutive readings 15 minutes apart show no change.
8. Dislodge any water held up in the condenser with a wire loop. Rinse the condenser with 5 mL toluene.
9. Continue distillation for 3-5 minutes, then cool the receiver to 25 ¬± 2 ¬∞C.
10. Allow the solvent and water layers to clear.
11. Read the volume of water to the nearest 0.1 mL and calculate the percentage.

### Calculation

The moisture content (% by mass) is calculated as:

\text{Moisture content (% by mass)} = \frac{100 \times V}{M}

Where:

- ùëâV = Volume of water collected (mL)
- ùëÄM = Mass of the test portion (g)
