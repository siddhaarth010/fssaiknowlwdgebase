### Scope

This method is a routine reference for determining the moisture content using vacuum oven

### Caution

- **Vacuum oven:** Forbidden for use in unattended or non-working hours. Always wear insulated gloves when handling samples in the heated oven. Open hot ovens with care. Stand to one side when opening the door to avoid high temperatures.
- **Desiccators:** Exercise extreme caution when opening and closing desiccators.

### Principle

The sample is ground, if pre-conditioning is required. A test portion is dried at a temperature of 130 ± 3 °C to a constant mass. The loss in mass is expressed as a percentage.

### Apparatus/Instruments

1. **Vacuum oven**
2. **Analytical balance:** Accurate to 0.001 g

### Materials and Reagents

- **Flat Bottom Moisture Dish with Cover:** Stainless steel, nickel, aluminum, or porcelain, approximately 80 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height.

### Method of Analysis

1. Weigh accurately about 5 g of the material into the dish previously dried and weighed.
2. Heat the dish containing the material (uncovered) in the vacuum oven maintained at a temperature between 60 °C and 70 °C and at a pressure of not more than 7,500 mm of Hg for about 2 hours.
3. Cover and cool the dish in a desiccator, then weigh it with the cover on.
4. Repeat the process of drying, cooling, and weighing at 30-minute intervals until the difference between two consecutive weighings is less than 1 mg.
5. Record the lowest mass.

### Calculation with Units of Expression

The moisture content, expressed as a percentage by mass of the product, is calculated as follows:

\text{Moisture (%) =} \left( \frac{W1 - W2}{W1 - W} \right) \times 100

Where:

- $W$ = Mass in g of the empty dish
- $W_1$ = Mass in g of the dish with the test portion before drying
- $W_2$ = Mass in g of the dish with the material after drying
